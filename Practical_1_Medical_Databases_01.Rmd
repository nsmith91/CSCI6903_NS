## Introduction

The Brazilian public health system, known as SUS for Unified Health System in its acronym in Portuguese, is one of the largest health system in the world, representing government investment of more than 9% of GDP. However, its operation is not homogeneous and there are distinct perceptions of quality from citizens in different regions of the country.  Non-attendance of medical appointments contributes a significant additional burden on limited medical resources.  This analysis will try and investigate possible factors behind non-attendance using an administrative database of appointment data from Vitoria, Espírito Santo, Brazil.

The data required is available via the [course website](https://github.com/maguire-lab/health_data_science_research/tree/master/static_files/practicals/lab1_data).

### Understanding the data

**1** Use the data dictionary describe each of the variables/features in the CSV in your report.

Data Dictionary:

PatientID: Unique identifier for each patient 
AppointmentID: Unique identifier to each appointment 
Gender: Patient Gender (limited to Male or Female)
ScheduledDate: date on which the appointment was scheduled
AppointmentDate: date of the actual appointment
Age: Patient age
Neighbourhood: District of Vitória in which the appointment 
SocialWelfare: Patient is a recipient of Bolsa Família welfare payments
Hypertension: Patient previously diagnoised with hypertensio (Boolean)
Diabetes: Patient previously diagnosed with diabetes (Boolean)
AlcoholUseDisorder: Patient previously diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (Boolean)
Disability: Patient previously diagnosed with a disability (severity rated 0-4)
SMSReceived: At least 1 reminder text sent before appointment (Boolean)
NoShow: Patient did not attend scheduled appointment (Boolean: Yes/No)

**2** Can you think of 3 hypotheses for why someone may be more likely to miss a medical appointment?

Three hypotheses as to why people may miss medical appointments:

1. Poor scheduling/no reminders
2. Distrust in the medical system 
3. Local events, fear of safety (political instability, COVID, etc.)

**3** Can you provide 3 examples of important contextual information that is missing in this data dictionary and dataset that could impact your analyses e.g., what type of medical appointment does each `AppointmentID` refer to?  

Contextual information missing in the data dictionary that could impact analyses:

1. Appointment type not specified
2. Appointment time of day could play a role (missing)
3. Time since previous diagnoses of alcohol use disorder (could be resolved?)
4. No physician ID or clinic ID, which could be informative

## Data Parsing and Cleaning

**4** Modify the following to make it reproducible i.e., downloads the data file directly from version control

```{r read_data, echo=TRUE}
raw.data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsmith91/CSCI6903_NS/main/2016_05v2_VitoriaAppointmentData.csv')#, col_types='ccfTTicllllflf')
```

Now we need to check data is valid: because we specified col_types and the data parsed without error most of our data seems to at least be formatted as we expect i.e., ages are integers

```{r}
raw.data %>% filter(Age > 110)
```
We can see there are 2 patient's older than 100 which seems suspicious but we can't actually say if this is impossible.

**5** Are there any individuals with impossible ages? If so we can drop this row using `filter` i.e., `data <- data %>% filter(CRITERIA)`

```{r check_age, echo=FALSE}
raw.data %>% filter(Age > 110)
raw.data %>% filter(Age < 0)
```

Assuming babies can be counted as patients (age=0), there is only one age values that doesn't make sense, at a value of -1

```{r drop_age, echo=FALSE}
data <- raw.data %>% filter(Age>=0)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
First, we should get an idea if the data meets our expectations, there are newborns in the data (`Age==0`) and we wouldn't expect any of these to be diagnosed with Diabetes, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Hypertension (although in theory it could be possible).  We can easily check this:

```{r}
raw.data %>% filter(Age == 0) %>% select(Hypertension, Diabetes, AlcoholUseDisorder) %>% unique()
```

We can also explore things like how many different neighborhoods are there and how many appoints are from each? 

```{r}
count(raw.data, Neighbourhood, sort = TRUE)
```
**6** What is the maximum number of appointments from the same patient?

```{r Exploratory, echo=FALSE}
#checking max number of appointments per patient:
count(raw.data, PatientID, sort = TRUE)
```

The maximum number is 88

Let's explore the correlation between variables:

```{r Correlation, echo=FALSE}

# let's define a plotting function
corplot = function(df){
  
  cor_matrix_raw <- round(cor(df),2)
  cor_matrix <- melt(cor_matrix_raw)
  
  
  #Get triangle of the correlation matrix
  #Lower Triangle
  get_lower_tri<-function(cor_matrix_raw){
    cor_matrix_raw[upper.tri(cor_matrix_raw)] <- NA
    return(cor_matrix_raw)
  }
  
  # Upper Triangle
  get_upper_tri <- function(cor_matrix_raw){
    cor_matrix_raw[lower.tri(cor_matrix_raw)]<- NA
    return(cor_matrix_raw)
  }
  
  upper_tri <- get_upper_tri(cor_matrix_raw)
  
  # Melt the correlation matrix
  cor_matrix <- melt(upper_tri, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Heatmap Plot
  cor_graph <- ggplot(data = cor_matrix, aes(Var2, Var1, fill = value))+
    geom_tile(color = "white")+
    scale_fill_gradient2(low = "darkorchid", high = "orangered", mid = "grey50", 
                         midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
                         name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
    theme_minimal()+ 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, 
                                     size = 8, hjust = 1))+
    coord_fixed()+ geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value), color = "black", size = 2) +
    theme(
      axis.title.x = element_blank(),
      axis.title.y = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.border = element_blank(),
      panel.background = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank())+
      ggtitle("Correlation Heatmap")+
      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
  cor_graph
}

numeric.data = mutate_all(raw.data, function(x) as.numeric(x))

# Plot Correlation Heatmap
corplot(numeric.data)

```

Correlation heatmaps are useful for identifying linear relationships between variables/features.
In this case, we are particularly interested in relationships between `NoShow` and any specific variables.

**7** Which parameters most strongly correlate with missing appointments (`NoShow`)?

AppointmentID and SMSReceived

**8** Are there any other variables which strongly correlate with one another?

Age and hypertension (0.5)
Age and diabetes (0.29)
Hypertension and diabetes (0.43)
Appointment ID and SMSReceived (-0.26)

**9** Do you see any issues with PatientID/AppointmentID being included in this plot? 

PatientID and AppointmentID are unique ID variables, not numerical data. It's possible that appointment ID has a systematic numbering convention that varies by clinic, explaining the observed correlation with SMSReceived

Let's look at some individual variables and their relationship with `NoShow`.

```{r,fig.align="center"}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=Age, fill=NoShow), alpha=0.8) + 
  ggtitle("Density of Age by Attendence")
```
There does seem to be a difference in the distribution of ages of people that miss and don't miss appointments.  
However, the shape of this distribution means the actual correlation is near 0 in the heatmap above. This highlights the need to look at individual variables.

Let's take a closer look at age by breaking it into categories.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
raw.data <- raw.data %>% mutate(Age.Range=cut_interval(Age, length=10))

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Age.Range, fill=NoShow)) + 
  ggtitle("Amount of No Show across Age Ranges")

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Age.Range, fill=NoShow), position='fill') + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of No Show across Age Ranges")

```

**10** How could you be misled if you only plotted 1 of these 2 plots of attendance by age group?

Only plotting proportion can be misleading because we do not have the total counts, so the age categories with very small numbers are misleading (such as 90-100, 110-120)

The key takeaway from this is that  number of individuals > 90 are very few from plot 1 so probably are very small so unlikely to make much of an impact on the overall distributions. 
However, other patterns do emerge such as 10-20 age group is nearly twice as likely to miss appointments as the 60-70 years old.

Another interesting finding is the `NA` group, they are the result of trying to assign age of 0 to groups and represent missing data.

```{r}
raw.data %>% filter(Age == 0) %>% count()
```

Next, we'll have a look at `SMSReceived` variable:

```{r,fig.align="center"}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=SMSReceived, fill=NoShow), alpha=0.8) + 
  ggtitle("Density of SMS received across Age and No Show")

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=SMSReceived, fill=NoShow), position='fill', alpha=0.8) + 
  ggtitle("Density of SMS received across Age and No Show")
```


**11** From this plot does it look like SMS reminders increase or decrease the chance of someone not attending an appointment? Why might the opposite actually be true (hint: think about biases)?

From these plots it looks like SMSReceived increase the chance of a NoShow. This may be because the places that send SMS reminders may also have other factors that increase the likelihood of a noshow. I.e., the places that send texts may be systematically different in some way which makes it less likely that indivduals will attend the appointment

**12** Create a similar plot which compares the the density of `NoShow` across the values of disability 

```{r plot_disability, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Disability, fill=NoShow), alpha=0.8) + 
  ggtitle("Count of SMS received across No Show")

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Disability, fill=NoShow), position='fill', alpha=0.8) + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of SMS received across No Show")
```

Now let's look at the neighbourhood data as location can correlate highly with many social determinants of health. 

```{r, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Neighbourhood, fill=NoShow)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1, size=5)) + 
  ggtitle('Attendance by Neighbourhood')


ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Neighbourhood, fill=NoShow), position='fill') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1, size=5)) + 
  ggtitle('Proportional Attendance by Neighbourhood')
```

Most neighborhoods have similar proportions of no-show but some have much higher and lower rates.

**13** Suggest a reason for differences in attendance rates across neighbourhoods.

Different neighbourhoods may have different characteristics that affect attendance- different kinds of clinics and appointments, different physical environments, different transportation 

Now let's explore the relationship between gender and NoShow.
```{r, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Gender, fill=NoShow))
  ggtitle("Gender by attendance")

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Gender, fill=NoShow), position='fill')
  ggtitle("Gender by attendance")

```

**14** Create a similar plot using `SocialWelfare`

```{r plot_SocialWelfare=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=SocialWelfare, fill=NoShow)) +
   ggtitle("SocialWelfare by attendance")

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=SocialWelfare, fill=NoShow), position='fill') +
   ggtitle("SocialWelfare by attendance")
```

Far more exploration could still be done, including dimensionality reduction approaches but although we have found some patterns there is no major/striking patterns on the data as it currently stands.

However, maybe we can generate some new features/variables that more strongly relate to the `NoShow`.

## Feature Engineering

Let's begin by seeing if appointments on any day of the week has more no-show's. Fortunately, the `lubridate` library makes this quite easy!

```{r}
raw.data <- raw.data %>% mutate(AppointmentDay = wday(AppointmentDate, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE), 
                                 ScheduledDay = wday(ScheduledDate,  label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE))

ggplot(raw.data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=AppointmentDay, fill=NoShow)) +
  ggtitle("Amount of No Show across Appointment Day") 

ggplot(raw.data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=AppointmentDay, fill=NoShow), position = 'fill') +
  ggtitle("Amount of No Show across Appointment Day") 

```
Let's begin by creating a variable called `Lag`, which is the difference between when an appointment was scheduled and the actual appointment.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
raw.data <- raw.data %>% mutate(Lag.days=difftime(AppointmentDate, ScheduledDate, units = "days"),
                                Lag.hours=difftime(AppointmentDate, ScheduledDate, units = "hours"))

ggplot(raw.data) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=Lag.days, fill=NoShow), alpha=0.7)+
  ggtitle("Density of Lag (days) by attendance")
```

**15** Have a look at the values in lag variable, does anything seem odd?

We have both positive and negative values for lag days (the number of days between the schedule date and the appointment date), which means sometimes the appointment was scheduled after the date it took place?


## Predictive Modeling

Let's see how well we can predict NoShow from the data. 

We'll start by preparing the data, followed by splitting it into testing and training set, modeling and finally, evaluating our results. For now we will subsample but please run on full dataset for final execution.


```{r}
### REMOVE SUBSAMPLING FOR FINAL MODEL
data.prep <- raw.data %>% select(-AppointmentID, -PatientID) #%>% sample_n(10000)

set.seed(42)
data.split <- initial_split(data.prep, prop = 0.7)
train  <- training(data.split)
test <- testing(data.split)
```

Let's now set the cross validation parameters, and add classProbs so we can use AUC as a metric for xgboost.

```{r}
fit.control <- trainControl(method="cv",number=3,
                           classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)
```

**16** Based on the EDA, how well do you think this is going to work?

I don't think very well given that we have some probable biases (e.g., reminders increasing NoShow) and data inconsistencies (e.g., lag days)

Now we can train our XGBoost model
```{r}
xgb.grid <- expand.grid(eta=c(0.05),
                       max_depth=c(4),colsample_bytree=1,
                       subsample=1, nrounds=500, gamma=0, min_child_weight=5)

xgb.model <- train(NoShow ~ .,data=train, method="xgbTree",metric="ROC",
                  tuneGrid=xgb.grid, trControl=fit.control)

xgb.pred <- predict(xgb.model, newdata=test)
xgb.probs <- predict(xgb.model, newdata=test, type="prob")
```

```{r}
test <- test %>% mutate(NoShow.numerical = ifelse(NoShow=="Yes",1,0))
confusionMatrix(xgb.pred, test$NoShow, positive="Yes")
paste("XGBoost Area under ROC Curve: ", round(auc(test$NoShow.numerical, xgb.probs[,2]),3), sep="")
```

This isn't an unreasonable performance, but let's look a bit more carefully at the correct and incorrect predictions,

```{r ,fig.align="center"}
xgb.probs$Actual = test$NoShow.numerical
xgb.probs$ActualClass = test$NoShow
xgb.probs$PredictedClass = xgb.pred
xgb.probs$Match = ifelse(xgb.probs$ActualClass == xgb.probs$PredictedClass,
                         "Correct","Incorrect")
# [4.8] Plot Accuracy
xgb.probs$Match = factor(xgb.probs$Match,levels=c("Incorrect","Correct"))
ggplot(xgb.probs,aes(x=Yes,y=Actual,color=Match))+
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2,size=0.25)+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey40","orangered"))+
  ggtitle("Visualizing Model Performance", "(Dust Plot)")
```


Finally, let's close it off with the variable importance of our model:

```{r,fig.align="center"}
results = data.frame(Feature = rownames(varImp(xgb.model)$importance)[1:10],
                     Importance = varImp(xgb.model)$importance[1:10,])

results$Feature = factor(results$Feature,levels=results$Feature)


# [4.10] Plot Variable Importance
ggplot(results, aes(x=Feature, y=Importance,fill=Importance))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  scale_fill_gradient(low="grey20",high="orangered")+
  ggtitle("XGBoost Variable Importance")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

**17** Using the [caret package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) fit and evaluate 1 other ML model on this data.

**18** Based on everything, do you think we can trust analyses based on this dataset? Explain your reasoning.
